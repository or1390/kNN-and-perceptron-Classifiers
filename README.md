# Mini-Project 1 - kNN and Perception algorithms
#### This project consists on implementation of two machine learning algorithms: kNN and Perception.
#### They can be used both for binary and multiclass classification. The aim was to implement them from scratch, without importing libraries which already have implemented those. 

#### In the main file, we can imported the files for each algorithm: kNN and Perception. 
#### In the main file, we do:
* Data reading and preprocessing
	1. Read the dataset.
	2. Shuffle it to pick up a random training sample. Also, a random test size of 0.3.
	3. In case the dataset is large( ex. a4a), we set a subset size to run it faster.
